# Plant-Species-Image-Classification

This project is an image classification model created using Google Teachable Machine. It is designed to recognize and classify 20 related plant species based on their images. The dataset includes multiple images per plant taken from different angles, lighting conditions, and backgrounds to improve recognition accuracy.

The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning concepts by collecting and organizing an image dataset, training an AI model, evaluating its performance using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix, and testing it through real-time or uploaded images. This project also helps demonstrate proper documentation and model presentation using GitHub and Markdown.
